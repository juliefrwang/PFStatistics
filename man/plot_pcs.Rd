\title{Plot PCs Visualization for a SNP}
\usage{
plot_pcs(
  pcs,
  snp_importance,
  snp_name,
  pc_x = "PC1",
  pc_y = "PC2",
  save_path = "."
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pcs}{Principal Components data (a matrix or data frame with at least two columns,
such as PC1, PC2, etc.) (n_samples x n_pcs).}

\item{snp_importance}{Numeric vector representing feature importance values for the
selected SNP (length n_samples).}

\item{snp_name}{Name of the SNP to visualize.}

\item{pc_x}{The name of the principal component to plot on the x-axis (e.g., "PC1").
Must be a column name in pcs (default: "PC1").}

\item{pc_y}{The name of the principal component to plot on the y-axis (e.g., "PC2").
Must be a column name in pcs (default: "PC2").}

\item{save_path}{The directory path where the plot will be saved
(default: current working directory).}
}
\value{
A ggplot object of the specified PCs colored by feature importance.
}
\description{
Creates a scatter plot of two principal components colored by SNP feature importance.
